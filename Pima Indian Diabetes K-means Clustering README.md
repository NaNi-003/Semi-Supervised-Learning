# Pima Indian Diabetes K-means Clustering
This Python script performs K-means clustering on the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset. It preprocesses the data, applies K-means clustering, and visualizes the results using PCA for dimensionality reduction.

## Overview:-
### This script demonstrates the following steps:-

1. Loading and preprocessing the Pima Indian Diabetes dataset.
2. Performing K-means clustering.
3. Visualizing the clusters using PCA.
4. Evaluating the clustering using the silhouette score.

## Installation:-
### To run this script, you need the following libraries:-

#### -> numpy
#### -> pandas
#### -> seaborn
#### -> matplotlib
#### -> scikit-learn
#### -> scipy
#### -> statsmodels

### You can install them using pip:

` pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn scipy statsmodels `

## Usage:-
1. Clone the repository or download the script file.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
3. Place the diabetes.csv dataset in the same directory as the script.
4. Run the script:-

` python pima_india_k_mean_clustering.py `

## Code Explanation:-

### 1. Importing Libraries
#### The script begins by importing the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, clustering, and evaluation.

### 2. Loading the Dataset
#### The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv(). The Outcome column is separated as the target variable.

### 3. Preprocessing
#### The features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### 4. K-means Clustering
#### K-means clustering is performed on the standardized features with 3 clusters.

### 5. Visualization
#### A scatter plot visualizes the clusters using the first two principal components obtained from PCA.
#### The silhouette score is calculated to evaluate the clustering.

### 6. Data Randomization and Merging
#### The script randomizes the dataset and creates a fake dataset by random permutation. It then merges real and fake datasets for further clustering and visualization.

### 7. Cluster Analysis
#### The script assigns labels to the clusters based on the majority vote of the original Outcome values within each cluster. It then visualizes the clusters with these labels.

### 8. Evaluation
#### Silhouette scores are calculated and plotted to evaluate the clustering quality.

## Results:-
1. The script outputs scatter plots showing the clustered data.
2. It prints the silhouette score, indicating the quality of clustering.
3. Cluster labels are determined and visualized based on the majority Outcome within each cluster.
