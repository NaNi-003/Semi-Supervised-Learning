# Gaussian Distributions and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Example
This repository contains Python code demonstrating the generation of random points from different types of Gaussian distributions and fitting a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to the data.

## Contents:- 
### 1. Univariate Gaussian Distribution:-
#### The univariate_gaussian.py script generates random points from a univariate Gaussian distribution with specified mean and standard deviation.
#### It also includes a scatter plot visualization of the generated points.
### 2. Multivariate Gaussian Distribution:-
#### The multivariate_gaussian.py script generates random points from a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a 2D mean vector and covariance matrix.
#### It visualizes the points in a scatter plot.
### 3. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):-
#### The gmm_example.py script fits a GMM to the combined points from three components.
#### It generates random samples from the learned GMM and plots both the original points and the sampled points.
## Usage:-
### 1. Clone this repository:-
` git clone https://github.com/your-username/gaussian-distributions-gmm.git `
` cd gaussian-distributions-gmm `

### 2. Run the desired Python scripts:-
#### To generate univariate Gaussian points:-
` python univariate_gaussian.py `
#### To generate multivariate Gaussian points:-
` python multivariate_gaussian.py `

#### To fit a GMM and visualize the results:-
` python gmm_example.py `

## Dependencies:-
### Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:-

#### 1. NumPy
#### 2. Matplotlib
#### 3. Scikit-learn (for GMM)
